A 3D engine written initially using OpenGL then rewritten to use the lower level graphics API Vulkan. The project aims to build everything from scratch (Data structures, Utilities, renderer, UI, physics, ...). The engine builds and runs on Windows and Linux. Support for Macos, Android and iOS is planned as well.

# Friendly reminder
This being a hobby project, implemented solely by one person, the mentality has been to move fast and break things. Though certain features of the engine are relatively mature, production level stability should not be expected or relied upon! In addition you may find parts of the engine aren't as configurable as they could be and this is not without reason. Features are developed in the order of when I need them and designed towards my use-cases, trying to be an all-round general engine isn't feasible on a 1 man project. If you are looking for an engine to use right out of the box, consider a commerical engine such as Unity, Unreal or Godot. If on the other hand you enjoy tinkering and are comfortable building out the engine, this could be an excellent starting point. Moreover development of new features will heavily depend on my spare time, as such there may be periods of massive improvements+changes and others of relative stagnation.
